## Problem Statement

In today's data-driven world, businesses struggle with efficiently handling and analyzing large volumes of data. Traditional data analysis methods require manual effort and domain expertise, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors. Furthermore, the integration of digital twin technology for real-time scenario simulation remains a challenge due to the complexity of data synchronization and processing.

**Challenges to address:**
- Inefficient and error-prone manual data preprocessing.
- Lack of automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) with insights.
- Limited integration of digital twin technology for predictive analytics.
- Challenges in scaling solutions to accommodate large datasets.

This project aims to bridge these gaps by leveraging AI-driven multi-agent systems to automate the data analysis pipeline and incorporate digital twins for real-time monitoring and optimization.
